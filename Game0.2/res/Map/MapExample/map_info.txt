# Map info formatting is as below:
map_length,start_x,bg_x_shift,back1_x_shift,back2_x_shift,main_speed,player_start_y

##
Where:
map_lenght= how long did you make your map? Height is stuck at 480
start_x= starting x location of everything, with the assumption y is 0
bg_x_shift= if the background moves, what speed? (put zero if no movement)
back1_x_shift=if the furthest back image moves, what speed? (put zero if no movement)
back2_x_shift=if the closer back image moves, what speed? (put zero if no movement)
main_speed= speed of main movement area
player_start_y= what y coordinate does the player's FEET start at on this map
