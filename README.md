# Punk_Game
All the increments/junk related to the rpg project about punks

Running -> Run and Select -> Game0.2 -> Punk Love

Punk Love shifts game from python to Lua LOVE framework.

Running has an infinite runner design with object instancing to break up the background, and object removal as well for some reason???

Run and Select now includes a second character and character selection option

Game0.2 does not work as a whole, but each individual section is set up to work on its own for testing. It has character selection, a level option, game menu with minigames.
